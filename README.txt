This project uses the FREEGLUT library to create simple 2D Pixel Graphics in C++.
It was designed for beginners like me who don't really understand how OpenGL works.
It is intended to be used in beginner emulator development for really old gaming consoles by drawing pixels to the screen.

The code was created by looking at and learning from many code snippets across the internet.
It is my hope that others don't have to go through the same "freeglut journey" as I did, spending 3 days 
with freeglut and OpenGL code, just to draw pixels to the screen.
